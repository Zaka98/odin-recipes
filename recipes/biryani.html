<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise, and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder.</li>

<li>Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; plise until coarsely chopped.</li>

<li>Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, chile powder, biryani masala powder, and turmeric in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 2 hours.</li>

<li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is partially cooked through and still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>

<li>Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine.</li>

<li>Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and chile peppers; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Careflily remove 1 tablespoon of ghee from the pot; set it aside.</li>

<li>Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add to the pot. Cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side. Spread drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on top of the rice. Drizzle reserved ghee and saffron milk over onions and rice.</li>

<li>Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until rice is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Cook's Notes:</h4>
<p>Substitute lamb for the chicken if preferred.</p>

<p>Substitute oil for the ghee if desired.</p>

<p>If you want biryani to look like dry, sprinkle oil on rice after you drain it and before you add it to the chicken.</p>
